# PDF-stego

A Python tool to hide information inside different elements in a PDF. The tool has two options: ENCODE and DECODE.

The ENCODE option generates a PDF simulating a Coldplay concert ticket with some information about it, an image and a QR. The application reads the content inside a plaintext file which is wanted to be hidden. 
The content must to be ciphered before being stored in the PDF, so the program generates a 128 bits random key and cipher the content with that key and stores the data using LSB in the image of the ticket generated. 
To preserve that random key for future decodings, the application generates a QR which stores it and then, that QR is hidden inside the visible QR in the PDF ticket. 
In order to secure the process of enconding and decoding information, during the decoding option, it is generated a Verification PIN and it is given to the user. That Verification PIN will be requested in the decoding option to get the hidden information.

In the DECODE option, user must provide the PDF name which contains the secret encoded on it and then, specify the Verification PIN which was generated during the encoding. If the PIN is correct, the message will be shown to him.
